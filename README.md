## (Recently Learned) Skills I Used
* modularizing code into multiple files
* ES6+ concepts, such as ```let```, ```const```, and arrow functions
* using NPM to initialize a project, and to install and import Node.js modules
* building an interactive command-line application that processes user input using a third-party module
* using string literals to dynamically generate markdown from the command line
